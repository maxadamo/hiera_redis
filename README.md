## Description

This module provides a Hiera 5 backend for Redis.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

The backend requires the [redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb) gem installed in the Puppet Server JRuby.
It can be installed with:

    /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver gem install redis

It is also recommended to install the gem into the agent's Ruby:

    /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install redis

This allows commands such as `puppet apply` or `puppet lookup` to use the backend.

### Beginning with hiera_redis

If Redis is running on the Puppet master with the default settings, specifying the `lookup_key` as 'redis_lookup_key' is sufficient, for example:

    ---
    version: 5
    hierarchy:
      - name: hiera_redis
        lookup_key: redis_lookup_key

## Usage

By default, the backend will query Redis with the key provided.
It is also possible to query multiple scopes such as with the YAML backend, where the expected key in Redis is composed of the scope and the key separated by a character (default is `:`). For example, the following can be used:

    ---
    version: 5
    hierarchy:
      - name: hiera_redis
        lookup_key: redis_lookup_key
        options:
          scopes:
            - "osfamily/%{facts.os.family}"
            - common

The backend then expects keys of a format such as `common:foo::bar` for a lookup of 'foo::bar'.

The other options available include:

* `host`: The host that Redis is located on. Defaults to 'localhost'.
* `port`: The port that Redis is running on. Defaults to 6379.
* `socket`: Optional Unix socket path
* `password`: Optional Redis password
* `db`: The database number to query on the Redis instance. Defaults to 0.
* `scope`: The scope to use when querying the database.
* `scopes`: An array of scopes to query. Cannot be used in conjunction with the `scope` option.
* `separator`: The character separator between the scope and key being queried. Defaults to ':'.

## Limitations

This module has only been tested on CentOS.

## Development
